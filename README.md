# STM32 Bare-Metal Embedded Labs

This repository brings together a set of practical embedded firmware development labs 
built on STM32 microcontrollers, focusing on low-level, bare-metal development without any IDE or third-party libraries.

## Topics Covered

1. [Build Process and GNU Tools]([./Build%20Process%20and%20GNU%20Tools/](https://github.com/bthandgn/stm32-baremetal-labs-/blob/main/Build%20Process%20and%20CNU%20Tools))
2. [Linker Script Lab](./linker-script-lab/)
3. [Startup File & Reset Handler](./startup-file-demo/)
4. [Makefile-Based Build System](./makefile-build-system/)
5. [Register Access from Datasheet](./register-access/)
6. [CMSIS Fundamentals](./cmsis-foundation/)
7. [Blinky Project (No IDE)](./blinky-no-ide/)

Each subproject contains its own source files, build system, and explanation.
